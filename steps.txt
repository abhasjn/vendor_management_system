Certainly! Here are the consolidated steps we followed for executing the project:

**Project Setup:**
1. Set up a Django project.
2. Create two Django apps: `vendors` and `purchase_orders`.
3. Define models for `Vendor` and `PurchaseOrder` in their respective apps.
4. Run migrations to create database tables for the models.

**Vendor Management:**
5. Define serializers for `Vendor` model.
6. Implement API views for CRUD operations on vendors.
7. Test the vendor endpoints using Django Rest Framework's browsable API.

**Purchase Order Management:**
8. Define serializers for `PurchaseOrder` model.
9. Implement API views for CRUD operations on purchase orders.
10. Test the purchase order endpoints using Django Rest Framework's browsable API.

**Vendor Performance Evaluation:**
11. Define models for `HistoricalPerformance` in the `vendors` app.
12. Implement backend logic for calculating performance metrics: On-Time Delivery Rate, Quality Rating Average, Average Response Time, and Fulfilment Rate.
13. Create utility functions for calculating performance metrics.
14. Add utility functions in the appropriate app (either `vendors` or `purchase_orders`).
15. Implement API views for retrieving vendor performance metrics.
16. Define serializers for vendor performance metrics.
17. Test the performance metrics endpoints using Django Rest Framework's browsable API.

**Additional Steps:**
18. Ensure that serializers are properly defined for all models.
19. Configure URLs for all API endpoints.
20. Test the entire API to ensure proper functionality and data consistency.

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Django project with APIs for managing vendors, purchase orders, and retrieving vendor performance metrics.
